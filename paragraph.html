<P>
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of a series of elements or tags that tell the browser how to display text, images, links, and other multimedia content. HTML forms the backbone of all web pages, providing the structure that CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can style and JavaScript can make interactive.</p>
